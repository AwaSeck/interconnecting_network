# interconnecting_network

Compilation: gcc -o peer peer.c
Execution: ./peer "graphe.txt"

The goal of this first part of the project is to create a network (graph) where each process (node) can only connect with the processes to which it is linked determined by the file, i.e. if there is an edge between those two.

This network or graph will be colored in the second part of the project.
